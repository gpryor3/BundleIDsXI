BundleIDsXI
===========

A Cydia application to retrieve the bundle ID of any of app on your device with the push of a button.

This was originally created by Noah Saso (Sassoty) but updated for iOS 11 seeing as it is no longer being updated by noah and is only compiled for 32-bit. A huge thanks to @TheTomMetzger and @Skittyblock for all of their insane help on this project. Also a massive shoutout to Ethan Whited for helping resolve the crash on iOS 13 while still keeping the app icons within the app. This project should currently supports all devices that run iOS 11.0.0 - 13.3.1.
