BundleIDsXI
===========

A Cydia application to retrieve the bundle ID of any of app on your device with the push of a button.

This was originally created by Noah Saso (Sassoty) but updated for iOS 11 seeing as it is no longer being updated by noah and is only compiled for 32-bit. A huge thanks to @TheTomMetzger and @Skittyblock for all of their insane help on this project. This project should currently supports all devices that run iOS 11.0.0 - 12.1.1. I currently have plans to add a few new features to this project as well to make it even better than the amazing work by the original developer as well as bringing the code a little more up to date.
